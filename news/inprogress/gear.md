In 2005, my amp was a heavy Hiwatt custom 100 head which is known to be a very
clean amp, almost hifi amp. I did not use any gain pedal so I had to pair 2
inputs together, push the volume high and tame the beast with a THD box between
the head and speakers. Paired with the very hot pickups of my Les Paul, it
started to crank.

All the looping was made with a echoplex and a huge and ugly midi pedalboard.

In 2008, I added a fuzz and a distortion to my lineup because I wanted the
overdrive of the sound to happen before entering the loop to avoid a too fuzzy
wall of sound. I changed the texture of the guitar sound with a old Whammy
Digitech and a line 6 synthesize pedal (I sold the whammy and regret it. They
have become so hard to find and expensive). A wha-wha put some extra flavor to
the highly modified sound. And I came back to the original EDP pedal which was
kind of buggy but compact.

Later on, I used 2 amps, my trusty hiwatt and a 50 watt Bedrock combo. The
bedrock was moslty used for coloring the sound of my synth. And I used 2
Echoplex in stereo. A Kaoss pad was here for more sonic destruction.

I've became more en more tired of moving my gear fo and from the trunk of my
car. In 2017, I moved to a small island in pacific ocean. I sold most of my
equipment. I bought a small orange transistor amp weighting a few kilos and
sufficient to make the wall of my wooden house trembling. I quit live looping
and keep an old boss delay as unique fx. Back in Europe in 2021, I bought a ZT
amp with a 12inch speaker. And the reincarnation of the Echoplex Digital Pro :
the loup√©. Oh, and I still use my old Les Paul as my main guitar.
