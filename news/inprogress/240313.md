In 2005, my amp was a heavy Hiwatt custom 100 head which is known to be a very
clean amp, almost hifi amp. I did not use any gain pedal so I had to pair 2
inputs together, push the volume high and tame the beast with a THD box between
the head and speakers. Paired with the very hot pickups of my Les Paul, it
started to crank.

All the looping was made with a echoplex and a huge midi pedalboard.

![pedalboard](img/pedalboard_2008.jpeg) In 2008, I added a fuzz and a distortion
to my lineup because I wanted the overdrive of the sound to happen before
entering the loop to avoid a too fuzzy wall of sound. I changed the texture of
the guitar sound with a old Whammy Digitech and a line 6 synthesize pedal (I
sold the whammy and regret it. They have become so hard to find expensive). A
wha-wha put some extra flavor to the highly modified sound. And I came back to
the original EDP pedal which was kind of buggy but compact.
