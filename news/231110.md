With the help of the excellent [Faircamp](https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/), I've
set up an online [microlabel](http://tsunami.oooooooooo.net/) as an alternative
way to show and sell my music. You can stream the whole catalogue for free and
download high quality files for a fair price. It's still in beta and there are
albums missing. It's a work in progress and I hope to have it ready in a few
weeks.
