# objet

![objet](image/objet.jpg)

blending electronic and rock influence, objet musical activities are centered
around guitar playing, live looping and weird home-built sequencers.

(re-)discovering old and new technology, playing drums, pushing keys and
buttons, hiding some of my favorite musicians into my own creation.

> "A very interesting and worthwhile solo live performance of In C done with
> loopers. Any performance of the piece where the fragments are looped loses
> some of the excitement of an ensemble performance, but for one person to do
> this in one take is remarkable. It works." - William Denton / Bandcamp
