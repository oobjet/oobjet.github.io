> "tempus fugit is the ritual music for a post-apocalyptic society which has
> descended into savagery in the bombed-out streets of new york. you're probably
> asking, if the music is this harsh, why should i care? tempus fugit is worth
> listening to for the same reason that we give such attention to classical
> music -- the thought and skill that goes into piecing these individual
> elements into a cohesive whole is he music was too complex for many, yet today
> it is impossible to discuss the high points of culture without invoking these
> same compositions" - ron davies / splendid
