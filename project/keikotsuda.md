> "Keiko Tsuda were one of the many players in the vibrant collective of French
> electronic math, which also includes bands like Geste, Jean Jean, Quadrupede,
> and Chevreuil. Perhaps what made albums like Sake Duo Kit stand out from the
> others was its eccentric punk aesthetic. The seven tracks on this debut
> incorporate looping and improvisation, are punchy, quirky, and have a rascally
> manner to them." - Bandcamp
